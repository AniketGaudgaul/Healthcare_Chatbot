# Healthcare Chatbot Application

This tool allows users to ask queries regarding the Healthcare related documents like Health Insurance Policy, Doctorâ€™s Diagnosis or Prescription. It utilizes RAG to retrieve relevant context from the PDF/Web text which is then provided to the LLM Model (GPT-3.5). The project is facilitated through a user-friendly web interface and a CLI method.
